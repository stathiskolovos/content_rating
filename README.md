# Lab: Content Rating Application to Like or Dislike Content

In this lab, you will create a React component called 'ContentRating' where the component will let users rate material by clicking 'like' or 'dislike' buttons. When the component is rendered for the first time, both the like and dislike counts are set to zero. You will create a method that changes the state to add one to the number of likes when a user selects the 'like' button. In the same way, clicking the 'dislike' button, the method will add one to the number of dislikes. This action lets users rate the content in an interactive way using like or dislike button and provides feedback to content creators.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Handle the component state in React using state variables to keep track of the number of likes and dislikes
2. Execute event handling when a user selects a button to like or dislike content
3. Create components and reuse them by building a Toggle component that includes both the content and rating features
4. Create an interactive user interface with React that can handle state and user events and render complex UI elements
